High discounts do not guarantee high sales — other factors like brand or reviews matter more.

Most products are rated 4.0+ — showing general customer satisfaction.

Least-rated products are concentrated in budget electronics and small appliances.

Least-selling products may require marketing, visibility, or quality fixes.
